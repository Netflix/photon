# Photon

Photon is an implementation of the Material Exchange Format (MXF) standard. MXF is a SMPTE standard defined in the
specification SMPTE st0377-1:2011. Photon parses and completely reads an MXF file containing a single audio or video essence
as defined by the IMF Essence Component (SMPTE st2067-5:2013) and serializes the metadata into an IMF Composition
Playlist (SMPTE st2067-3:2013).

The goal of the Photon is to provide a simple standardized interface to completely interpret an MXF essence.

## Build

Photon can be built very easily by using the included Gradle wrapper. Having downloaded the sources, simply invoke the
following commands inside the folder containing the sources:

$ ./gradlew clean
$ ./gradlew build

## JDK requirements

Photon can be built using JDK-8. Support for earlier jdk versions has not been tested and/or verified.
